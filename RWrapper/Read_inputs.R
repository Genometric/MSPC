# Package MSPC
# Function read_inputs

# This function reads the input files given by the user and checks if
# the inputs are bed files or a GRanges objects.
# if the input is a bed file, nothing happens.
# if it's a Granges list or Granges object, it transforms it into bed files
# and returns the name of the bed files created by the function,
# that will be given to the program mspc

# Note :
# This function only accepts one type of arguments.
# The user should either give all the input arguments as bed files
# or as GRanges objects, i√âe, the user cannot give an input argument that contains
# bed files and GRanges objects.
