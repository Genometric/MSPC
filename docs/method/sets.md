MSPC classifies peaks under `Background`, `Weak`, `Stringent`,
`Confirmed`, `Discarded`, `True-Positive`, and `False-Positive`
categories. (Refer to [method description](method/about.md)
for details.) The following figure is a schematic view of 
these categories and their relation.

(The number of ERs in different sets reported in this figure, are the 
result of `wgEncodeSydhTfbsK562CmycStdAlnRep1` and 
`wgEncodeSydhTfbsK562CmycStdAlnRep2` (available for download from 
[Sample Data page](sample_data)) comparative analysis using 
`-r bio -w 1e-4 -s 1e-8` parameters.)
