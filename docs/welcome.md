MSPC comparatively evaluates ChIP-seq peaks and combines the statistical significance of 
repeated evidences, with the aim of lowering the minimum significance required to “rescue” 
weak peaks; hence reducing false-negatives. 


MSPC can be used from: 

- [**Command Line Interface (CLI)**](cli/args.md): call MSPC CLI from your favorite terminal with necessary 
arguments, and it writes the analysis results to BED files.

- **As a library in your project**: call it from your program using your data types (or 
built-in types), and it will return analysis results to your program.
