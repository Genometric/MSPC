MSPC comparatively evaluates ChIP-seq peaks and combines the statistical significance of 
repeated evidences, with the aim of lowering the minimum significance required to “rescue” 
weak peaks; hence reducing false-negatives. 


MSPC can be used from: 

- [**Command Line Interface (CLI)**](cli/about.md): call MSPC CLI from your favorite terminal with necessary 
arguments, and it writes the analysis results to BED files.

- [**As a library in your project**](library/about.md): call it from your program, and it returns analysis 
results to your program.
