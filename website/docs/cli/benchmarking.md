title: Performance
---

We continuously improve MSPCâ€™s performance. We strive to speed up 
the runtime and decrease resource requirements with every release. 
We stress-test every release of MSPC and benchmark it against earlier
 versions to identify and resolve performance regression.

The scripts and data we use for benchmarking are publicly available. 
The data are listed in the [sample data](sample_data.md) page, 
and the scripts are distributed along with MSPC (i.e., `benchmark.exe`).
